# Octagon vs PC

This project aims to compare the implementation of the classical propagator from [lala-pc](https://github.com/lattice-land/lala-pc) and the octagon implementation from [lala-octagon](https://github.com/lattice-land/lala-octagon) for managing temporal constraint of the form  `± x ± y <= k` where `x` and `y` are variables and `k` is a constant.
